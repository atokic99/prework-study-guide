        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
            <li>Opening and closing tags are represented with angle brackets.</li>
            <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
            <li>The title element defines the title for for a webpage.</li>
            <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
            <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
            <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
            <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, descriptions, keywords, author, and viewpoints.</li>
            <li>The charset element sets our character encoding.</li>
            <li>The viewport element sets the default view for the webpage.</li>
            <li>The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
            <li>Elements inside other elements are called child elements. The element that holds all the kids are called parent elements, parent/child language is used the explain relationships among elements in HTML.</li>
            <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element.</li>
            <li>div creates division in the page or span to create an inline division.</li>
            <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
            <li>The ul, ol, and li, elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
            <li>The ul element contains an unordered list or bullet list.</li>
            <li>The img element contains info about the images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
            <li>Cont. the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
            <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break of content.</li>
            <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
            <li>The herf attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
            <li>To style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
            <li>The period before card makes this a class selector.</li>
            <li>Any HTMl element that is assigned to the class, card, will get the property assigned from CSS.</li>
            <li>The box-shadow CSS property assds shadow effects around an element's frame.</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
            <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
            <li>git push: saves what we worked on</li>        
            <li>git commit -m commits changes to github</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To declare a variable use keyword var.</li>
            <li>After the var keyword, we give the variable a name.</li>
            <li>Use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data stored in our varible.</li>
            <li>Console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code.</li>
            <li>.log() is a method, is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer.</li>
            <li>The .log() method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
            <li>To link JavaScript to HTML we use similar steps as we did to CSS, but we add it under the footer element in HTML.</li>
            <li>Control Flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is read top to bottom, and order counts. Must be intentional about how we set up code in a JS file; can't just throw all in there in any way!</li>
            <li>Control Flow can be interuppted, but we can use conditional statments and loops to control the order in which code is executed.</li>
            <li>An if statment is a way of introducing decision-making into our code.</li>
            <li>The if statment code, will only execute if the statment meets a condition, or is true.</li>
            <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy.</li>
            <li>If the "if" statment provides to be truthy, then it will do whatever action we ask of it to do in between the curly brakets i.e."{}".</li>
            <li>But if the condition isn't true or have a value that isn't truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the culry brackets and move on.</li>
            <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
            <li> Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
            <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array.</li>
            <li>This location is identified with a unique number called an index.</li>
            <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. Meaning that the first item in any array has an index of 0 not 1.</li>
            <li>A "for" loop uses the perdictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over again.</li>
            <li>By using a "for" loop, we can tell the computer to go through each og the shapes in our array and log them to the console.</li>
            <li>The array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array.</li>
            <li>We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriatly named "length".</li>
            <li>A "for" loop contains 3 important statements.</li>
            <li>The first statment determins the stating point for our loop.</li>
            <li>The second statment is the condition.</li>
            <li>The third statment is what allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
